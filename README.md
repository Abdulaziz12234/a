# Hotel Booking System

## Overview

The Hotel Booking System allows users to make reservations, register an account, and manage their stay at a hotel. It includes HTML pages for user interaction, Java for backend functionality, and SQL to handle the database structure.

## Features

- **Checkout Process**: Handles checkout logic with `CheckoutP.java`.
- **Database Setup**: SQL file to initialize the required tables for the hotel booking system.

## How to Run

1. **Set up the database**: Run the `HotelBookingSystem-STEP-1.sql` script to initialize the database on your SQL server.
2. **Host the HTML files**: Upload the `index.html`, `Register.html`, and `reservation.html` to your web server or open them locally.
3. **Java Backend**: Compile and run `CheckoutP.java` to handle the checkout process.
