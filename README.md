## Overview

The Hotel Booking System allows users to register, log in, make reservations, and manage their stay. The system includes HTML pages for user interaction, Java for backend functionality, and SQL to handle the database. 

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register via `Register.html`.
- **User Login**: Users can log in via the `Login.html` page.

- **Checkout Process**: Handles checkout logic with `CheckoutP.java`.
- **Database Setup**: SQL file to initialize the required tables for the hotel booking system.

## How to Run

1. **Set up the database**: Run the `HotelBookingSystem-STEP-1.sql` script to initialize the database on your SQL server.
2. **Host the HTML files**: Upload the `index.html`, `Register.html`, `Login.html`, and `reservation.html` to your web server or open them locally.
3. **Java Backend**: Compile and run `CheckoutP.java` to handle the checkout process.
